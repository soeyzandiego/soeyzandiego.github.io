            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Zoey. I was born and raised in central Illinois, about two hours south of Chicago. I'm currently based in Lower Manhattan.</p>
            <p>I'm an undergraduate student at New York University, majoring in Game Design at Tisch School of the Arts with a minor in Child/Adolescent Mental Health Studies.</p>
            <p>I've been making games as a hobby for about five years now. This site showcases a handful of digital games I've made over the years.</p>
            <p>When I'm not making games, I'm playing them! And if I'm not playing games, I'm definitely building with LEGOs.</p>
